# Login/Signup Project (HTML and CSS)

This project features two simple web pages: **Login** and **Signup**. They are created using only **HTML** and **CSS** and provide a basic user interface for login and signup forms.

The pages are static and do not include any JavaScript or back-end logic. They mainly serve as templates for login and signup interfaces.

## Features

- **Signup Page**:
  - Signup form with fields for:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password
    - Confirm Password
  - Basic validation of field structure (however, no dynamic validation or logic is implemented on the client side).

- **Login Page**:
  - Login form with fields for:
    - Username
    - Password
  - This is a visual form with no dynamic interaction.

These pages are purely front-end, meaning there is no data processing (no saving or verification of users).

## Prerequisites

This project does not require any complex development environment. You just need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to view the pages.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/projet-login-signup.git

These pages are purely visual templates. They do not include any server-side processing or dynamic validation.
